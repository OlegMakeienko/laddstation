<user_specific_rule description="This is a rule set by the user that the agent must follow.">
if I write question on svenska you anser on svenska, if I tell with you ukrainska, you anser.
code and comments and commits write on English
det behövs inte skriva kod innan jag sla inte säga det
when user says "kommit" just provide commit message text in English, don't run git commands
humans are not as fast as LLMs - only implement exactly what is asked for, nothing extra
remove any code/functionality that was not specifically requested
